Other small clippings are scattered around the larger sections of text, including a French language clipping from Banville\'s poem "Lapins",  reading "Nous sommes les tendres Lapins / Assis sur leurs petits derrières", two separate clippings with lines from Thomas\'s "To the Memory of Sir Isaac Newton", one reading "Dreaming in whispering groves, by the hoarse brook"  and the other reading "That now he wanders through those endless worlds", lines from "The Nut-Brown Maid" reading "O lord, what is this worldys blysse that changeth as the mone!/ My somers day in lusty may is derked before the none. / I here you say, farewell: Nay, nay, we depart nat so sone./ Why say ye so? Wheder wyll ye go? Alas!

Next to this baby photo, Morgan has pasted a short poem, reading "Hey Diddle Diddle / Humpty, Dumpty/ Twinkle, Twinkle / Ding, Dong, Bell". Elsewhere on the page is a clipping that describes a fight between a dragon and a boar from Malory\'s Le Morte D\'arthur, a clipping titled "The Sleeping Dragon of Snowdon (Caernarvonshire)" that describes Merlin\'s discovery of two sleeping dragons beneath the land where chief Vortigern was attempting to build a castle, a clipping, titled "The Lambton Worm (Durham)", which describes a great worm that the heir of Lambton allowed to live when he discovered that the only way to kill it would be to kill his own father. For this failure to act, the heir suffers a sibyl\'s curse. Another clipping, titled "King Oswald\'s Arm (Bamborough, Yorkshire)", describes King Oswald\'s generosity to beggars at an Easter feast, and a subsequent blessing prayed on the "arm which performed the deed" by Bishop Aidan. Although Oswald was killed in battle, his arm is said not to have decayed in 900 years.

Morgan has included a black and white photograph of a relief bust of Rousseau, a Reader\'s Digest clipping quoting the N.Y.

He has written "(supposed)" above the assertion that is a self-portrait and has added notes reading "Enamel Medallion (Louvre)" and another "NB: the eyes are lighter then appears in this reproduction; the expression even more perplexed & farseeing. EM". Below these clippings is a black and white photograph of a night sky and a crater-covered landscape (possibly a rendering of the moon?), as well as a black and white photograph of what Morgan notes as "noctiluca" (Noctilucales). In the lower left of the page is a black and white newspaper photograph of a bird, captioned as "One of Nature\'s Freaks - This Fairy Swallow, with wings growing from its feet, was caught at Lumphanan, Aberdeenshire. It is now tame, and when on view soon draws a crowd." This page also includes four Brittanica clippings. "The Devil\'s Arrows (Aldborough, Yorkshire)" tells of a debate between Christian and Druid beliefs in which a devil disguised himself and began to sway favour away from the Christian until it was seen that his feet were melting the rock he stood on. "The White Hare (Cornwall)" discusses the belief that broken-hearted maidens reappear after death as white hares. "The Glastonbury Thorn (Glastonbury, Somerset)" describes the great fecundity of a tree that grew from Joseph of Arimathea\'s hawthorn staff. "The Dancers of Stanton Drew (Somerset)" tells of a bride who refused to stop dancing on her wedding night, even when warned that the party had extended into the Lord\'s Day. A fiddler arrived who played through the night, but soon the party found they could not stop dancing. In the morning, the revelers were gone and groups of stones were in their place. Other clippings include a large excerpt from Wordsworth\'s "The Simplon Pass", beginning with the lines "The immeasurable height/ Of woods decaying, never to be decayed" and ending with "Characters of the great Apocalypse,/ The types and symbols of Eternity,/ Of first, and last, and midst, and without/ end", two clippings with lines from Spenser\'s The Faerie Queene, one reading "And all within the riuen walls were hung/ With ragged monuments of times forepast/ All which the sad effects of discord sung:" and the other reading "The great earthes wombe they open to the sky", lines from Webster\'s The White Devil reading "Thou hast led me, like an heathen sacrifice,/ With music, and with fatal yokes of flowers", lines that read "Far fragrant orchards flinging slaking fruit,/ Where syrups press upon the weeping feet", and a clipping of Chinese characters that shows the combination of characters used to make certain words. One of these shows that Peace combines the character for Roof and Woman, under which Morgan has written "Soloman!". Another clipping describes supplies for a large feast, including "500 pints of clear mock turtle soup", "230 roast chickens" and "12 dozen bottles of beer, and red and white wine". Another clipping says that 76-year-old John Frederick Cotty was found "unfit to plead to a charge of murdering his wife, Amy Blanche Cotty (78)" and so was detained "during His Majesty\'s pleasure". Image-based clippings on the page include two clippings that show decorative relief carvings, a small black and white image that is difficult to make out, a black and white photograph of what appear to be carvings of lions, a black and white photograph of a medallion with a horse\'s head cut out in the center, and a black and white photograph of three worms or larvae, as well as pink and blue ink doodles, decorate the page.'},{people_ids:["76","75","79","80","14"],sources_ids:["10","29","28","21","695"],people_roles:{14:["Author/Writer"],75:["Author/Writer"],76:["Author/Writer"],79:["Depicted in clipping"],80:["Author/Writer"]},clippings:9,suffix:"",places_ids:["80"],notes:"",number:"231",orig_material:"N",orientations:["mixed"],book_id:"1",keywords:["Poetry","Hare","Rabbit","Geese","Crane","Birds","Graves","Tombs","Nightingale","Ichneumon","Bat","Nature","Art","Carving","Latin Language","Death","Animals","Painting","Carving","Sculpture","Sing"],stats:{people_nationalities:{Roman:1,"Egyptian ":1,American:1,English:1},people_genders:{Male:4},source_dates:{},sources_rights_holders:{"Odhams Press Ltd.":1},sources_places:{"London, UK":1},people_titles:{"official scribe and grain accountant in ancient Egypt":1,writer:1,"writer, Order of Merit":1},place_counts_dict:{},people_dates_lived:{}},foldout:"Y",id:"18",desc:'This page is dominated by a large clipping from Zoo magazine showing four black and white photographs.

The third image is a photograph of a "tomb sculpture of an ichneumon climbing a branch to rob a bird\'s nest". The last image is a photograph of a wall painting from the tomb of Nebamun, which shows Nebamun hunting birds in the Nile marshes (dated around 1350 BC). This clipping is large and its inside right edge has been folded over to make it fit into the book. On the back of the fold, Morgan has pasted five other clippings. One is a black and white photograph what Morgan has annotated as being a Feather Box from New Zealand, one is an unclear black and white image, probably excerpted from a larger image, one is a clipping titled "Frog, Toad, and Fish" that describes the author\'s discovery of a toad embracing a female frog, which reminds the author of having seen a frog embracing a goldfish before, one clipping is a black and white photograph of a bat with its wings folded, and the final clipping is a black and white photograph of a rock formation.

Below this clipping, Morgan has included a small black and white photograph of a section of a stone relief carving showing figures on horseback, as well as a verse from Donne\'s "Elegy on the Lady Markham", which reads "In her this sea of death hath made no breach, / But as the tide doth wash the slimie beach, / And leaves embroder\'d workes upon the sand / So is her flesh refin\'d by deaths cold hand". Along the right side of the Creation clipping, Morgan has included a short line of text from Spenser\'s The Faerie Queene reading "Death is the end of woes: die soone, O faeries / sonne" and a black and white photograph of an ornate clock face. The third clipping is a photograph of a stone statue of the Virgin Mary, which Morgan has labelled "Virgin: Westminster: C13". Along the left side of this image, Morgan has included a small black and white photograph of a crucifix, as well as three text clippings, including lines from the poem "My Truest Treasure", which read "My dearworthy darling, so dolefully dight,/ Sa straitly up-right, strained on the rood;/ For Thy mickle meekness, Thy mercy, Thy might,/ Thou bete all my bales with bote of Thy blood", the lines "But direfull deadly blacke both leafe and bloom/ Fit to adorne the dead, and decke the drery / toombe" from The Faerie Queene, and a single line that reads "He confessed to being no orator, but was nevertheless brief."

Let no night/ Seal thy sense in deathly slumber/ Till to delight/ Thou have paid thy utmost blessing;/ Since that all things thou wouldst praise/ Beauty took from those who loved them/ In other days", and a clipping that may be in Old English. Many of these clippings discuss love and/or beauty that can survive death, although one clipping, from Henry King\'s "Exequy on his Wife", laments the loss of his wife and reads "But thou wilt never more appear/ Folded within my Hemisphear,/ Since both thy light and motion/ Like a fled Star is fall\'n and gon,/ And twixt me and my soules dear wish/ The earth now interposed is,/ Which such a strange eclipse doth make/ As ne\'er was read in Almanake".

The great instrument of moral good is the imagination; and poetry administers to the effect by acting upon the cause", and lines from von Harbou\'s Metropolis, reading "I have known those in the ectasy of desire to have forced women down to them from the highest part of the shell\'s wall, that they, diving, like seagulls, without injuring a limb, while others have fallen to their death. That man there was no God, no Storm, no Fire, and his drunkenness most certainly inspired him with no desire. It seems to me that he has come up from hell and its roaring in the intoxication of damnation. He did not know that the ecstasy for men who are damned is also damnation".

Also included on this page is clipping reporting on Mr. William Barnes, who is considered to be a healer. He is quoted as stating that he can even heal those who don\'t believe, making it different to faith healing. Other paranormal activities, including crockery moving and breaking on its own, ghostly images appearing on blank photographic plates, and wood burning when Barnes touches it, are also reported. A second text-based clipping is titled "The Deep\'s Deepest Mystery" and is excerpted by the Reader\'s Digest from The Log of Bob Bartlett. This clipping describes the Mary Celeste, a ship that was sailing from New York to Genoa in 1872. On 5 December, a British brigantine intercepted the Mary Celeste, finding the ship entirely empty, with no signs of violence, struggle, or corpses. The article reports that no information on the disappearance has ever surfaced. There are two other small clippings on the page, one from the Mahābhārata, reading "13. Hateless toward all born beings, friendly, and pitiful, void of the thought of a Mine and an I, bearing indifferently pain and pleasure, patient", and one from the Bhagavad Gita, reading "Malancha samupadaya | kanchanim samalamkritam/ Avatirna tato rangam | Draupadi Bharatarshabha".

Wood. The demonstration showed a slab of quartz being subjected to "an oscillating current of 280,000 periods a second and 50,000 volts tension" in a bowl of oil. A glass of water containing a live fish was then placed in the oil, causing the fish to die. The demonstration also showed hands being burned by touching glass that had been placed in the oil, despite the glass not being heated. The article closes by saying it is unclear in the fish experiment whether "it is that ultra-sonic waves heat the body to such an extent as to cause death, or whether death is determined by the liberation of the gases forming part of the blood". Along the top of the page, an Old English paragraph has been clipped, as has a newspaper photograph from the Bulletin showing a sandstone slab with hieroglyphics and captioned as "This sandstone slab, measuring three feet in length, with raised hieroglyphics, has been discovered on the farm of Garth, Harray, Orkney".

Around the larger clipping Morgan has pasted smaller images, including decorative black and white photographs of ornate carvings, a photograph of a carved Asian figure (possibly a full statue, although the clipping shows only the head and shoulders), a black and white photograph of a relief carving of a person, and a reproduction of a drawing of a mountain, which is captioned "Mount Hor". This page also includes two short articles. The first is from the Evening News and reports Professor Jansky\'s claims that he has "received short-wave radio signals which originate from some station beyond the earth", the basis for which claim he cites as the fact that the signals "take three to fifteen seconds to reach his receiver," fixing "the place of their origin at a spot many millions of miles from the earth". Jansky says that he will "construct the most powerful shortwave receiver in the world, so that he can study these signals more closely," and reminds cynics that extraterrestrial communication is possible, given that "our more powerful military short-wave transmitters send signals that could be received in the moon if anyone happened to be there". The second article is from the Bulletin and is titled "Chilled Himself Into Insanity: Land of Errors". It describes Sir Joseph Barcroft\'s efforts to explore the "borderland of insanity by chilling his body to the early stages of freezing" in order to "pass beyond the \'censorship of the mind\'. He says he chilled himself to the degree that "nerve censorship" let go, and he found that "he had no natural apprehension lest some person alien to the experiment should enter the room and find him unclad".

What a man thinks, that he is; this is the old secret". The page also contains two clippings from an article with the subtitles of "Fruit with a Poisonous Breath" and "If Apples Breathed More Slowly". The clippings describe the work of two South African scientists who grew sprouts in "a box through which blew air that had passed over rows of ripe peaches". The sprouts shriveled within a week. Plums were found to have the same effect. The scientists discovered that "ethylene is the culprit" and are now exploring if ethylene could be "used for stopping fruit from ripening too soon," meaning "fresher and better fruit from beyond the seas".

The article states that wood-carving is in "danger of dying out completely" due to an opening up of the country and devaluing of African art at home. It also discusses a carver named Bamgboye, who is said to be "one of the best of the surviving Yoruba carvers". Next to this clipping is a black and white photograph of a carving, captioned as "A dignified iroko carving representing the head of a Yoruba woman", to which Morgan has added a note reading "by Bamgboye". Around the carving clipping, Morgan has drawn small ink doodles that resemble seaweed and bubbles. Other clippings include two colour images of cartoonish characters, a black and white photograph of a porcelain man holding a cup in one hand and a pitcher in another, a black and white photograph of a frieze showing many figures, and four lines from Racine\'s Phèdre, reading "Il a vu le Cocyte et les rivages sombres,/ Et s\'est montré vivant aux infernales ombres;/ Mais qu\'il n\'a pu sortir de ce triste sèjour,/ Et repasser les bords qu\'on passe sans retour". In the center of the page is a colour drawing of a fish, captioned as a "Greater Weever-Fish", as well as a large clipping that shows three black and white photographs of a wall-plaque by Bamgboye. The first image shows the entire wall plaque, and is captioned as being "carved on a mahogany plank about four feet long. The scenes from right to left represent the birth, life and death of a hunter. Two of the panels are illustrated on a larger scale below". The second photograph shows the center panel, which is captioned as "Enjoying life: the village chief wearing necklaces and holding fly whisk with musicians and friends", and the third photograph shows the left panel, described as "Death: the wives are mourning and friends are firing dane guns. The body, wrapped in a cloth, is lying on a mat. Above it are some of the dead man\'s possessions: a hoe, matchet, axe, pocket knife, pipe, carved stool and waist band". Onto this clipping, between the first and second and the second and third images, Morgan has pasted in extra clippings, both of which are black and white photographs that are difficult to make out, although the second photograph may be of a carving of some sort. Other clippings include a black and white reproduction of Gromaire\'s painting "Le faucheur flamand", depicting a Flemish man hammering out a sickle, and a small clipping reading, "Because her husband came home late once too often Mrs Jane Wolf, of Cape Town, picked up a bottle of methylated spirits, poured it over him, and set him alight. Then when she saw the flames she threw water over him and put the fire out. Mrs Wolf, who is 28 and has three children, pleaded guilty to a charge of assault. Mr Wolf, who was in court carrying a baby, asked the magistrate to let her off with a caution".

Also included is a handwritten clipping with lines of verse from the anonymous Scottish poem "Welcome Eild", reading "As shadow in the sonnies beam/ Or primrose in the winter shower / So all my day is bot ane dream/ And half the sleeping of any hour", and an illustrated article from the Evening News that describes the ways in which Egyptian cultures placed value on certain "juices or \'life-givers\'" such as hair, saliva, and tears. The article states that many "old graves when opened are found to contain tiny glass or earthenware vessels known as tear-bottles", which would have been filled with mourners\' tears and "laid beside the corpse as \'soul-substance\'". The article includes a drawing of two tear-bottles, underneath which is quoted Psalms 56-8: "Put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?" Next to this clipping, Morgan has pasted a clipping of a short description of two men, McDonald and McKinnan, who killed the last Auk to be seen in Britain.

The heads are hollow and each has a circular hole about 3 ins. in diameter at the back of the skull". On this clipping, Morgan has written "see 1499", referring to another scrapbook page. Below this clipping is a larger photograph of the head labelled C. The head is shown in profile and the photograph is captioned as "Side view of head (C). The small holes in the face penetrate to the interior. The bronze is about 1/4 in. thick". Onto this clipping, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of cylindrical stones that looks like it might be from the Giant\'s Causeway in Northern Ireland, as well as a black and white photograph of a man in uniform holding up a large sheet and a black and white image of something that is difficult to make out, but might be a stone carving. Morgan has also added pink ink lines and doodles around the two extra clippings collaged onto the page. Next to the photograph of head (C), Morgan has included a second photograph, this one straight on and close up, of head (B). Around these 3 larger clippings Morgan has included lines from Dunbar\'s "Lament for the Makers", reading "Our pleasance here is all vain glory,/ This false world is but transitory,/ The flesh is bruckle, the Fiend is slee;/ Timor mortis conturbat me", a coloured cartoonish drawing of what might be a side view of a mask and four coloured dots, a black and white photograph of a carved stone frieze, a black and white full-body profile photograph of a man dressed in Roman costume, a black and white ceramic or porcelain male figure holding a mug, a colour drawing showing three prawns, one red, one green and one blue, with the caption "The Aesop Prawn", and an illustration from "Ommie Wise", an American murder ballad, showing the murder of Ommie (or Naomi Wise) at the hands of her lover, John Lewis. Also included are two short articles. The first states that "Cosmic rays destroy on Earth about one atom per cubic centimeter per second", thus attesting to life\'s "incredible persistence" and "ability to adapt itself to [the] unbelievable rigors" of Earth. The article emphasizes the importance of procreation to the continuance of life, and states that "Our atmosphere is a futile shield against the terrific power of cosmic particles. Only the invisible, intangible defenses of the Sun\'s vast magnetic field, and Earth\'s lesser one protect us, make it possible for human beings to have human children, and not give birth to monstrous, unnamable things". The second article is from Picture Post and discusses a "telescope with a lens 100 inches wide" which has been used to photograph Jupiter. These photographs have enabled the discovery of two new moons, bringing the known total to 11. The article then states that when Galileo first posited that Jupiter had four moons, "Certain important Cardinals had no difficulty in proving that Galileo must be wrong. A dignitary named Sizzi roundly said, \'The moons are invisible to the naked eye, and therefore can have no influence on the earth, and therefore would be useless, and therefore do not exist!\'". The article concludes by stating that it also appears that Jupiter\'s sky is "utterly hidden by thick clouds".'},{people_ids:["104","259","2","41","28","260"],sources_ids:["215","216","216","152","217","218"],people_roles:{2:["Author/Writer"],28:["Depicted in clipping"],41:["Depicted in clipping"],104:["Illustrator/Artist"],259:["Illustrator/Artist"],260:["Illustrator/Artist"]},clippings:9,suffix:"",places_ids:["178","179"],notes:"",number:"259",orig_material:"N",orientations:["mixed"],book_id:"1",keywords:["Art","Religion","Sea","Cidaris","Sea Urchin","Gorgonocephalus","Culture","Language","Cat","Dog","Rat","Fish","Poetry","Animals","Painting","Drawing","Diagram"],stats:{people_nationalities:{German:2,"Galilean Jewish":2,English:2},people_genders:{Male:5,Female:1},source_dates:{},sources_rights_holders:{},sources_places:{Glasgow:1},people_titles:{writer:1,"Catholic saint":1,painter:2,"surgeon, zoologist, FRS":1},place_counts_dict:{},people_dates_lived:{}},foldout:"N",id:"46",desc:'This page features two large black and white reproductions of paintings.

The clipping describes a 22-year-old girl who was born blind but recovered her sight. The article describes how difficult things like walking up stairs and judging distances became for her, as well as her disappointment in the look of some things, such as animals in the zoo (which she thought would be bigger) and human faces (which she said had less happy expressions that she had expected and which she had difficulty in distinguishing from one another at first). Above and below this clipping Morgan has included small black and white images. The top image is a black and white photograph that appears to show light reflecting on water and the bottom image is difficult to make out, but may also be depicting water. The page also contains a black and white photograph of two stone figures that appear to be sitting together in a vessel, a black and white photograph of a male sculpture standing with his arms extended out to the side and raised at his elbows, a black and white photograph of a carved head, possibly a mask, and a clipping with two black and white photographs of stone relief sculptures, one a detailed dragon\'s head and one that appears to depict a mermaid, jointly captioned as "Examples of Makara and Khmer sculpture recently excavated and now included among the pieces for exhibition in the new galleries of the Musée Guinet, Paris". Morgan has also included the first several lines from the poem "Song to the Wind", which appears in the Book of Teliesin, reading "Discover thou what is/ The strong creature from before the flood,/ Without flesh, without bone,/ Without vein, without blood,/ Without head, without feet,/ It will neither be older nor younger/ Than at the beginning;/ For fear of a denial,/ There are no rude wants/ With creatures./ Great God! how the sea whitens/ When first it comes!/ Great are its gusts/ When it comes from the south;/ Great are its evaporations/ When it strikes on coasts./ It is in the field, it is in the wood,/ Without hand, and without foot,/ Without signs of old age,/ Though it be co-aeval/ With the five ages or periods".

The caption reads "On this and the facing page we see some intimate glimpses of the life of the seahorse. Opposite is recorded a moment in the courtship of the fishes. This is quite an elaborate ceremony, the pair circling each other in the water, swimming gracefully around and around. The wooing soon nears its climax and the male and female fishes approach one another. The female transfers her eggs into the pouch of the male, and they are believed to be fertilized at this time. They remain in the pouch for about forty-five days. Lower right is a male with a pouch swollen by prospective small seahorses. One can almost imagine an unhappy look on the paternal face. Above, on this page, the male fish bumps his distended pouch on a shell, possibly with a desire to hasten the day of the ejection of the little ones. Below, through the X-ray, we see the exterior and interior skeleton of the seahorse and the shadowy pouch, and, finally, a tiny new seahorse wriggling out of its father\'s pouch. The young are minatures of the adults and soon are on their own, instictively attaching themselves to something and starting to feed. More than one female may deposit her eggs in the pouch of a single male." Onto the seahorse clipping, Morgan has pasted a small, original black and white photograph of a man in briefs posing, a black and white photograph showing a sculpture on the side of what looks ot be a building or a gate, and a black and white photograph of a painted vase. Above the vase clipping, and just below the seahorse caption, Morgan has written "See 113", referring to another scrapbook page. Below the seahorse clipping, Morgan has included a black and white reproduction of a painting that shows foliage, a small dead animal, and the feet of people, likely a detail image clipped from a larger work, a black and white photograph of a mask, a black and white aerial photograph showing a farm house with what look to be stacks of some type of harvest in front of it, and a black and white photograph of a small rabbit.

The first lines of the clipping read "The best portion of a hair to study is the middle third of its length; its characteristics are all fully formed, yet not frayed or mutilated through environmental wear. The parts of a hair are an outer cuticula, a wide cortex, and a narrow central medulla. The cuticle consists of great numbers of minute, structureless, transparent, imbircated scales, the apices pointing toward the tip of the hair; the overlapping of the scales reminds one of shingles on a roof or of scales on the body of a fish. As shown by the numerous studies of Professor L. A. Hausman, the size, pattern, and sculpturing of these scales is specific, identification of the species being generally possible from their inspection. This work has played an important role in detection of spurious fur garments. Bat hair is the most interesting of all types for its complex scales and has long been a favorite with the microscopist." The clipping continues, discussing the characteristics of various parts of a hair, including pigment in coloured hairs. Also included on this page is a clipping that includes a photograph of a magnfied hair and a magnified photograph of a human scalp, captioned as "Above, scales of human hair, oblique illumiation, magnified 140X. At left, horizontal section of human scalp, hairs in cross section in their folicles. Magnified 80X." Overlapping with the image of the human hair, Morgan has included a black and white photograph of curtained window with a person\'s face visible behind the somewhat transparent curtain.

Also included on this page is a text-based clipping from Martin Buber\'s I and Thou, which reads "First, there is the whole fulness of real mutual action, of the being raised and bound up in relation: the man can give no account at all of how the binding in relation is brough about, nor does it in any way lighten his life - it makes life heavier, but heavy with meaning. Secondly, there is the inexpressible confirmation of meaning. Meaning is assured. Nothing can any longer be meaningless. The question about the meaning of life is no longer there. But were it there, it would not have to be answered. You do no know how to exhibit and define the meaning of life, you have no formula or picture for it, and yet it has more certitude for you than the perceptions of your senses. What does the revealed and concealed meaning purpose with us, desire with us? It does not wish to be explained (nor are we able to do that) but only to be done by us. Thirdly, this meaning is not that of \'another life\', but that of htis life of ours, not one of a world \'yonder\' but that of this world of ours, and it desires its confirmation in this life and in relation with this world. This meaning can be received, but not experienced; it cannot be experienced but it can be done, and this is its purpose with us". A second text-based clipping on this page is titled "The Price of Hornlessness", written by John Hammond, D.Sc., F.R.S.. It states that "The craze for selecting hornless goats has increased the percentage of intersexual or hermaphrodite animals which have usually the external appearance of a female, but in which the internal reproductive organs have been changed over in varying degrees to the male side, so that they are incapable of breeding". The clipping cites research by S. A. Asdell, in which three hundred intersexed animals were examined, all of which were hornless. Asdell argues that the goats started as female, but were modified in development by "a [recessive] gene, or chemical hereditable matter, which causes hornlessness". The article states that "Something of a similar nature is known in cattle. The so-called White Heifer disease is caused by a gene which is closely linked with white colour. Almost all cases of this disease occur in white animals, although of course the great majority of white animals are perfectly normal and only a few have the gene for the disease". The clipping continues, stating that "\'Freemartins\' or intersexes in cattle are not caused by a gene, but by the transfusing of the blood of the male in utero to the female, changing its internal sex organs over to the male side".

In the conditions of anaerobic fermentation there was not much fear of putrefaction of the meat, although what happened to it after it disappeared, leaving only the bone, is beyond my knowledge. I think you can take it that the practice is now practically unknown. What I was in France before the War - taking a party of cider makers round the wine districts - we were asked to sample the wines from two vates, one of which contained a wine of greatly superior quality to the other. On asking the purpose of this test, we were told that in the better vat of wine they had discovered the skeleton of a baby and it was surmised that in some way this was connected with the improvement in flavour.\' *".

The first photograph shows a detail from the Norman West Doorway of Tutbury Church, the second shows the monument to Godfrey and Avena de Foljambe at All Saints Church in Bakewell, and the last shows a Reredos depicting Mary and Child, as well as a man, a woman, and seventeen children, incribed to Robert and Joan Gilbert at All Saints Church in Youlgreave. Other clippings on this page include a black and white photograph of a carved pillar in front of a river or lake with a mountain in the background, a text-based clipping from Gilbert Chesterton\'s St Francis of Assisi, which reads "one night the people of Assisi thought the trees and the holy house were on fire, and rushed up to extinguish the conflagration. But they found all quiet within, where St. Francis broke bread with St. Clare at one of their rare meetings, and talked of the love of God", and a small line of text that reads "the most copious and rural harmony", likely from Edward Lear\'s "The Story of theFour Little Children Who Went Round the World". Another text-based clipping on the page appears on blueish-gray paper, with the subtitle "The first performance of the Shostakovitch 129th in F in London last night was marred by four fatalities, to which reference is made elsewhere. It remains for the critic to say that they luckily had no effect on the performance of the work, which showed the East Grinstead at its versatile best". The clipping continues, stating that "The dead of the Bruno Xlavski is a serious loss to music. Those of us who have watched his meteoric rise since he first discarded the triangle will feel an irreparable blow. It is a fitting comment on his genius to say that he piloted the Shostakovitch 129th masterfully, to his end. The last three hours of the work showed how brilliantly the orchestra can rise to an emergency. Other sections from the clipping read "Music has also lost by the death of Smith, the Croat whose work as a sound effectist has been noticeable in a number of modern orchestras. He was particularly effective on the air raid siren." Referring to the new symphony, the clipping states that "The composer - who saw in, by the way, from Leningrad, as he abominates the English spring and would not travel - has used his whole battery of technical resource. Twelve drummers and eight sound effects men made up a massive wall of orchestral sound, through which the 32 first violins succeeded in occasionally interpolating a line of pure if reluctant melody. The symphony is divided into 28 movements of which the last six are the longest. There are thematic associations between alternate thrid movements, with repercussions in the undertones. There is thus a haunting effect as of an idea being systematically followed by a diminishing echo, and the critical appreciation needs tuning up to it". The clipping concludes under the subtitle "Gas Jet Hiss", and reads "All this will need sorting out by the various Shostakovitch societies all over the world.[sic] most of whom, we think, will find it hard to accept the master\'s early introduction of the idea of an escaping gas jet - a noise produced by the sound effectists with the utmost stealth. It was hissed by the audience. It plays a valuable part, however, in the overtones of the dominant introductory theme, and he would be a brave man indeed who would find fault. A memorable night."'},{people_ids:["806","807","808","809","743","6"],sources_ids:["570","571","572","573","574","595"],people_roles:{6:["Illustrator/Artist"],743:["Illustrator/Artist"],806:["Illustrator/Artist"],807:["Named in clipping"],808:["Named in clipping"],809:["Depicted in clipping"]},clippings:8,suffix:"",places_ids:["678","679","3","99","672","680","681"],notes:"",number:"815",orig_material:"N",orientations:["portrait"],book_id:"4",keywords:["Relief","Church","Tomb","Death","Horse","Chalice","History","Religion","Statue","Faun","Mythology","Blind","Men","Pottery","Flowers","Culture","Art"],stats:{people_nationalities:{"Franco-English":1,English:2,Dutch:1},people_genders:{Male:5},source_dates:{},sources_rights_holders:{"National Museum of Ireland":1},sources_places:{},people_titles:{"Earl of Leicester":1,"2nd Earl of Pembroke":1,potter:1,painter:1,"god of art, beauty, dance, flowers, song, fertility, agriculture":1},place_counts_dict:{},people_dates_lived:{}},foldout:"N",id:"177",desc:'This page includes a black and white clipping with two detail photographs showing figures on horseback carved in stone.

(Penzance), who reminds me that the Scilly Isles, west of the westernmost tip of England, are crowded with prehistoric graves - three times more than the whole of Cornwall, a region itself rich in them. A Cornish historian cites a case in the time of Edward I, where he considers as pointing to the survival of some pagan sacrifice to the setting sun. A woman and her two daughters, convicted of larceny, were taken to Maen Escop (the old Cornish name for Bishop\'s Rock, the well-known Atlantic lighthouse and the most westerly point of England) with two barley loaves and a pitcher of water, and there left to be drowned by the waves of the sea. Since the old name for Scilly was Sull-ey (Sun Island), it seems to me probable that human sacrifice to the sun may have been offered there; though I should not have thought it would be specifically to the setting sun, which would surely be seen to have gone even further west."'},{people_ids:["28","41","74","689","817","817","818","819","820","821","6"],sources_ids:["583","584","585","586","587","588"],people_roles:{6:["Illustrator/Artist"],28:["Depicted in clipping"],41:["Depicted in clipping"],74:["Depicted in clipping"],689:["Illustrator/Artist"],817:["Illustrator/Artist","Author/Writer"],818:["Author/Writer"],819:["Translator"],820:["Author/Writer"],821:["Named in clipping"]},clippings:15,suffix:"",places_ids:["688","108","687"],notes:"",number:"818",orig_material:"N",orientations:["mixed"],book_id:"4",keywords:["Snake","Boa Constrictor","Apple","Pear","Nuts","Meat","Fish","Bread","Butter","Wine","Beer","Gnat","Ant","Flea","Badger","Men","Women","Religion","Paratrooper","Parachute","Clock","Russian Language","Dutch Language","Middle English","Bull","Bull Fighting","Clothes","Luxery","Royalty","Wedding","Cross","History","Culture","Landscape","Dance","Carving","Painting","Poetry","Ivory","Animals","Food"],stats:{people_nationalities:{Irish:1,Flemish:1,French:1,English:2,"Galilean Jewish":2,Italian:1},people_genders:{Male:8,Female:1},source_dates:{},sources_rights_holders:{},sources_places:{},people_titles:{"poet, playwrite, merchant":1,"monk, poet":1,"artist, wood engraver, writer":1,"Cistercian, writer":1,"1st Duke of Buckingham, coutier, statesman, possible lover of King James I of England":1,"Catholic saint":1,painter:1},place_counts_dict:{},people_dates_lived:{}},foldout:"N",id:"180",desc:'This page includes a black and white photograph of a carved relief tryptych, annotated by Morgan as "Byzantine: Ivory Triptych C10", a black and white reproduction of Matnegna\'s Presentazione di Gesù al Tempio (Presentation of Christ in the temple), which Morgan has annotated with the artist\'s last name, a black and white photograph of paratroopers, some standing on the ground and some in flight in the sky with parachutes open, a black and white photograph of an clock face decorated with painted men and women in formal wear and showing the time 2:40, a text-based clipping in Russian, a colour reproduction of a c1570 painting once identified as Mary, Queen of Scots, but now listed as Unknown Woman, a black and white photograph of a matador and a bull in a ring at a bull fight, a small black and white photograph of a hilly landscape, a small black and white photograph of what looks to be a group dancers bending backwards, a black and white drawing of a standing cross, captioned as "A standing cross on Inishmore, Aran Islands.

The first is a short clipping from 1951 stating that the Loch Ness monster was seen "about four miles west of Bona Ferry by 81-years-old crofter, Duncan Chisholm, of Balloan, Caplich; two 13-year-old boys, Jacky Ross and Melvyn Waller; and Miss J. MacDonald, of Abriachan." Chisholm described the monster as looking like a submarine that was travelling slowly. The second is a clipping from 1950 titled "Loch Ness Monster Seen Again", which states that "Lady Maud Ballie, Balindarroch Lodge, Scaniport, Inverness . . . and her cousin, Lady Spring Rice, have reported seeing the Loch Ness monster while touring the lochside by car".'},{people_ids:["346","522","523","524","525","526","527","528","529","530","531","532","533"],sources_ids:["335","336","337","338","339","340","24"],people_roles:{346:["Illustrator/Artist"],522:["Illustrator/Artist"],523:["Depicted in clipping"],524:["Illustrator/Artist"],525:["Illustrator/Artist"],526:["Named in clipping"],527:["Named in clipping"],528:["Named in clipping"],529:["Named in clipping"],530:["Named in clipping"],531:["Named in clipping"],532:["Named in clipping"],533:["Named in clipping"]},clippings:13,suffix:"",places_ids:["455","456","122","457","458","453","459","201","73","460","461"],notes:"",number:"1490",orig_material:"N",orientations:["portrait"],book_id:"3",keywords:["Monster","Loch Ness Monster","Nessie","Nessy","Art","Mountains","Snow","Skiing","Sports","Nature","Art","Dance","Music","Musical Instrument","Toffee","Mince Pie","Animals","Dog","Women","Men","Science","Research","Experiment","Spider","Insect","Crystal","Lava","Hydrochloric Acid","Silicate of Potash","Eggs","Fossil","Devil","Mystery","Unknown Species"],stats:{people_nationalities:{Spanish:1,Mexican:1,Dutch:1,American:1,English:5,Swiss:1},people_genders:{Male:10,Female:3},source_dates:{},sources_rights_holders:{},sources_places:{"Glasgow, UK":1},people_titles:{"saw the Loch Ness monster":2,"Damn, poet, critic":1,"social theorist":1,"lieutenant-commander in the British Royal Navy, writer, horologist":1,"burlesque dancer, actress, author":1,scientist:1,"reporter who first reported Loch Ness Monster":1,"artist, writer":1,"amateur scientist":1,"goldsmith, painter, printmaker, mercenary soldier":1,painter:2},place_counts_dict:{},people_dates_lived:{}},foldout:"N",id:"110",desc:'This page includes a large article clipping discussing an amateur scientist named Crosse, who "dropped a lump of lava from Vesuvius into a solution of hydrochloric acid and silicate of potash which he electrified from a battery with the idea of making crystals of silica." Instead, two weeks later, "white nipples showed up on the lava," and in four days, these grew legs and emerged as small white spiders, unlike any known species. Crosse\'s experiment caused controversy and he was accused by some of being in "league with the devil". The experiment has never been successfully repeated, and the article offers Faraday\'s theory that the insects "had been fossilized in the stone and were revived by the current in the solution. More likely still is the theory that the creatures hatched out of eggs by the electric force that acted on them like an incubator". The clipping also includes two wood-block prints, one showing an array of scientific test tubes in front of a smoking volcano and one a decorative drawing of a crystal. Morgan has annotated this clipping with the source (Enquiry), but has also noted "see R.T. Gould, Oddities, 1944" for further reading. This page also features three clippings concerning the Loch Ness Monster. The first is titled "Nessy\'s Pa Mort", and reads "John C. MacKay, the reporter who first sent out stories about the Loch Ness Monster, died at Inverness, 7-17-52 old style. He was 84. Nessy survives however. She was \'seen\' in May." The second clipping is untitled and reads "On her first visit to Scotland, Gypsy Rose Lee took a quick trip up to Loch Ness. She wanted the monster to see her." The final clipping is titled "Nessie is on Show Again", and reports that "two appearances by the Loch Ness monster on successive evenings were reported". The first sighting was by "Robert Burrell, a fishing ghillie; Roderick MacLean, a hotel employee; and a London chauffeur who was driving American visitors on a Scottish tour." The second sighting was by "an Army officer from Fort George," who claimed to have watched the monster for "almost 20 minutes". Other clippings on this page include a colour reproduction of a sketch captioned as "\'Head of a Young Woman\'; by Hugo Van der Goes (c. 1405-82).

The first is Van Gogh\'s "Still Life with Gloves", captioned in this clipping as "VINCENT VAN GOGH (1853-1890). Still Life with Gloves. (Collection of Mr. T. Van Blaaderen)". The second is a still life, which includes grapes, a grape branch, peaches, flowers, a small brown mouse, and brown, white, and orange butterfly, captioned as "Jan Van Huysum. 1682-1749." Between these two reproductions, Morgan has included two small text-based clippings. The first reads "The Moscow Literary Gazette has condemned Russian parents who give their children such names as \'Electrification\' and \'Cracking Combine.\' One boy was recently named \'Detector,\' the writer complained." The second is a hand-written clipping that reads, "Comme je demandais à Genet pourquoi il refusait de connaître Gide, il me répondit : \'On est accusé ou juge. Je n\'aime pas les juges qui se penchent amouseusement vers les accusés.\' J.C." To the right of these clippings, Morgan has included a long article discussing Einstein\'s "new cosmic theory, \'a generalised theory of gravitation,\' which attempts to interpret in one synthesis the known physical phenomena of the material world." The article states that the announcement of the theory was planned "to coincide with the opening . . . of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science." It also says that Einstein himself has acknowledged that he has "not yet found a practical way . . . to confront the results of the theory with experimental evidence." The article then considers how long it took for Einstein\'s theories of relativity and general relativity to find proof and discusses how this new theory seeks to address "the resistance of electro-magnetism to explain itself in terms of the theory that successfully interpreted time, space, matter, energy, gravitation, and inertia." No comment was given by those at the American Association meeting, and the publication date for the full text is said to be February. The article says that questions that Einstein says he has answered with this work are "Why are there only a few specific types of elementary particles that go to make up atoms? Why do all electrons and protons have the same charge? Why do bodies produce gravitational fields?" Einstein is also said to be continuing on "with his lifetime\'s ambition, which is to harmonise the quantum theory and the relativity theory."'},{people_ids:["153","540"],sources_ids:["342","343","344"],people_roles:{153:["Illustrator/Artist"],540:["Illustrator/Artist"]},clippings:7,suffix:"",places_ids:["463","464","465","466","467","468","469"],notes:"",number:"1492",orig_material:"N",orientations:["portrait"],book_id:"3",keywords:["Art","Architecture","Temple","Religion","Dog","Dalmation","Telescope","Technology","Cactus","Desert","Advertisement","Steel","Mail","Men","Male Body","Soldier","Landscape","Trees","Humour","Language","Miscommunication","Impressionist"],stats:{people_nationalities:{Italian:1,Dutch:1},people_genders:{Male:2},source_dates:{},sources_rights_holders:{},sources_places:{},people_titles:{painter:2},place_counts_dict:{},people_dates_lived:{}},foldout:"N",id:"112",desc:'This page includes a black and white reproduction of van Gogh\'s "View in the Crau from Montmajour", captioned as "34.

Burton considers some of the many factors, including captivity, that can impact longevity and, in turn, our understanding of an animal\'s full potential longevity. However, he refutes claims such as "the belief that the large tortoises live to 500 years of age" and that Indian elephants and blue whales can live up to 200 years. The article concludes by stating that "attention may be drawn to the obvious difficulties of obtaining reliable information on longevity in all but captive and domesticated animals. There is, however, one exception, namely, the fishes, for the scales of many species living in the temperate zones show rings of annual growth, as in cross-sections of the trunks of trees, and similar rings are found in the otoliths". The article includes a sepia-toned photograph of several otoliths, with a caption reading "One of the few accurate means of determining the age of an animal: Otoliths (bony concretions in the inner ear) of the hake, with annual zones of growth clearly marked. In his article on this page, Dr. Burton reveals the difficulty of arriving at an accurate knowledge of the life-span of animals. Fishes, however, are among the few animals whose age can be read. This is done by means of the annual growth rings on the scales or otoliths, bony concretions which are found in the inner ear. Both of these are, however, unreliable after about nine years, as at this age the annual zones become narrower and difficult to define".

Next to this article, likely from the same Lilliput magazine as the article clipping, Morgan has included a clipping which reproduces four photographs by Nadar, each of them captioned. The first is "Georges [sic] Sand, whose novels changed from love-stories to social propaganda", "Wagner, in the days of his unacknowledged genius, one of Nadar\'s first works", "The novelist Flaubert, himself a master of photographic realism in prose", and "Rossini, when the veteran composer had almost resigned from musical activity".

The captioned photographs are "Kibo from E.N.-E., showing the erosion of the glaciers and, on the right, the inner crater area. On the left (southern) rim is Kilimanjaro\'s highest point, Kaiser Wilhelm Spitze (19,565 ft.). In the background, circled by clouds, can be seen the summit of Mount Meru (14,979 ft.), 45 miles to the west of Kilimanjaro.

In the upper left corner of the image of the map, Morgan has written "see P. 1575", referring to another scrapbook page. On the top photograph of Kibo from E.N-E, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of an older man\'s face into the clouds above the mountain. The article segment discusses Rev. Johannes Rebmann\'s first encounter with Kilimanjaro in 1848, including his surprise at seeing snow in Africa and his assertion that the presence of the snow and cold explained the dominant belief that evil spirits blocked access to the mountain. The segment concludes by stating that "Kilimanjaro consists of two main peaks joined by a long saddle at an altitude of about 16,000 ft. The secondary peak, Mawenzi (17546 ft.), is an extinct volcano and geologically very much older and, consequently, more weathered than Kibo. Being virtually free of permanent snow and ice, Mawenzi (\'Dark Mountain\') presents a dark, jagged appearance very different from the round, ice-domed symmetry of Kibo (\'Shining Mountain\') (19565 ft)."

Robson.)\", and \"An eroded ice-cliff - an example of 'nieve penitente,' caused by vertical weathering. Such fantastic shapes are common on Kilimanjaro. (Photograph: E. Robson.)\". The article excerpt discusses the initial publications of Rebmann's reports on Kilimanjaro, and particularly the report, surprising at the time, \"that mountains covered with perpetual snow could be found just under the Equator\". The article then discusses 1943 and 1945 expeditions to Kilimanjaro by Lieut.-Commander P. C. Spink \"to examine the curious structure of glaciers under the influence of an equatorial sun. Such glaciers present an interesting study for the glaciologist, since, unlike those of high latitudes, they are subjected to vertical sun-rays, resulting in a vertical type of weathering, with curious and almost freak effects. 'Nieve penitente' formations are common, a good example being seen in one of the photographs above, and another fascinating effect is the lamination of snow surfaces. In places, the latter assumes the form of thin sheets of snow, like the leaves of a book, about six inches apart, up to two feet high, and extremely fragile. It is thought that this effect is caused by the combined action of sun and wind upon the frozen mass of snowfield, the crystalline parts remaining erect in this strange fashion. The steady shrinkage of the ice area of Kibo is manifest on the outer glaciers. Ablation of the smooth, firm surfaces takes the form of huge horizontal and parallel ice-steps, and this erosion can be seen clearly.\" Other clippings on this page include a black and white photograph of a bulldog standing on its hind legs and looking over a wire fence, a black and white photograph of what appears to be a pillar or column, a black and white photograph of a man in uniform on a large ship taken from below the level of the ship's deck, a black and white photograph of a curved brick wall, a black and white photograph of a man lying on his stomach while propped up on his elbows and wearing cowboy boots, a cowboy hat, and a plaid shirt, a black and white photograph of a man lying on his back with his eyes closed, whom appears to have a boxing glove on one hand and so may have been knocked out, a black and white photograph of a waterfall, and a black and white photograph of two young men in an industrial indoor space leaning over a fire.

F. Barber. The article opens with an anecdote about Robert Louis Stevenson\'s dad, Thomas Stevenson, setting him to "measure the height of waves on the sea and the strength of the wind, to check a simple rule about the growth of waves which the elder Stevenson had propounded". The rest of the article goes on to discuss the study of waves by engineers and devised schemes to, for example, obtain "power from breaking waves by guiding them to throw water into a lagoon some 10 or 15 ft. above sea-level, electrical power being generated where the enclosed water runs off through turbines". The article continues by discussing the increasingly scientific study of waves, measuring, for example, the great distances they can travel once generated by a storm. Research by the Admiralty focuses on "being able to forecast those times when the surf will be low enough to permit sea-going ships to be laden by small shore craft". The article states that "At the Admiralty wave-recording station in Perranporth, Cornwall, are various instruments which distinguish swell by its characteristic long time-interval", which can act as a warning for incoming danger. The article also states that "the most satisfactory prediction of waves and swell is based on a detailed knowledge of the storms that produce it. The wind systems over all the North Atlantic Ocean are summarised in charts issued every six hours by the Air Ministry and by the Admiralty, showing the \'fronts\' or boundaries of the circulating masses of cold and warmer air which make up storms, contours of the areas of high and low barometric pressure and a large number of measurements of wind. Ships of all nationalities make these observations while on voyage and report them by wireless". There are also special ships at six positions in the North Atlantic used for monitoring weather and waves. The article reports that "It is curious to note that fish by their behaviour can indicate the presence of a distant storm even before the ground swell reaches them", demonstrated, for example, by the fact that cod and haddock will avoid certain eating or resting grounds that prove to be later affected by a storm. The article includes a black and white photograph of waves breaking on a beach, captioned as "Swell from a mid-Atlantic storm arriving at Perranporth, North Cornwall, where the Admiralty wave-recording station has various instruments which distinguish swell by its characteristic long time-interval". An abstract for the article is also included below the picture, which reads "In the \'World of Science\' article on this page, Mr. N. F. Barber discusses some of the aspects of research into the movement of waves and the effect of storms on the surf which beats upon beaches some thousands of miles from the centre of the disturbance. Perranporth, whose flat and sandy beach open to the Atlantic swell has made it famous for its surf-riding, also provides the site for an Admiralty wave-recording station". Also included on this page is a colour photograph of a colourful bird, which Morgan has annotated as a hoopoe, a black and white photograph of a man in a handstand with his legs stretched out behind him parallel with the floor, captioned as "The Original Peter, a popular variety and television act", a short clipping that reads "\'Ninety Milwaukee tenants, all wearing masks, appeal for rent controls before a State legislature committee\' in Madison, May 15.

Farewell, G.B.S. Literary genius of the century lies in state at Ayot St. Lawrence", which Morgan has annotated with the year 1950, a black and white photograph of a statue, captioned as "Head of a girl, 1932, by Picasso", a colour clipping from Bruegel\'s "The Triumph of Death" showing an army of skeletons marching, a small original black and white photograph of a man in a posing pouch holding onto a large ring or hula-hoop, and a colour reproduction of a drawing, captioned as "In a village squires and farmers play quoits. In this Rowlandson caricature a rustic prepares to throw, men drink beer, woman waves broom". Also included on this page is a black and white photograph of a young boy, which Morgan has annotated as "\'Mayerling\' Rudolfth", referring to Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, who died in an assumed murder-suicide known as the Mayerling Incident. In the bottom right hand of the photograph, Morgan has pasted a line of text that reads "A Genteel Youth".  Next to this clipping, Morgan has included a black and white photograph of a woman, which he has annotated as "Mary Vetsera", or Baroness Marie Alexandrine von Vetsera, who was Rudolf\'s mistress and who also died in the Mayorling Incident.'},{people_ids:["535","428","636","637","638","639","640","641","642","643","644","645","646","647","648","649"],sources_ids:["258","426","427","428","429"],people_roles:{428:["Named in clipping"],535:["Author/Writer"],636:["Named in clipping"],637:["Named in clipping"],638:["Named in clipping"],639:["Named in clipping"],640:["Named in clipping"],641:["Named in clipping"],642:["Named in clipping"],643:["Named in clipping"],644:["Named in clipping"],645:["Named in clipping"],646:["Named in clipping"],647:["Named in clipping"],648:["Named in clipping"],649:["Illustrator/Artist"]},clippings:5,suffix:"",places_ids:["113","196","520","521","462","54","5","389","522","214"],notes:"",number:"1511",orig_material:"N",orientations:["portrait"],book_id:"3",keywords:["Women","Men","Art","Letter","War","Atom Bomb","Hiroshima","Destruction","Dog","Science","Research","Psychoanalysis","Atomic Space Ships","Rocket","Morality","Technology"],stats:{people_nationalities:{"British-American":1,Dutch:1,"Hungarian-American":1,English:4,American:5,Scottish:1,Austrian:1},people_genders:{Male:16},source_dates:{},sources_rights_holders:{},sources_places:{Glasgow:1},people_titles:{"33rd President of the United States":1,"Dr., psychiatrist, consultant to the UN, founder of New York Psychiatric Centre":1,"Jr., conservationist, president of the New York Zoological Society":1,"KBE, journalist":1,"attorney, public administrator, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission":1,writer:1,"Dr., writer, government reformer":1,demographer:1,"theoretical physicist, engineer, mathematician":1,"Sir, PRS, mathematician, astonomer, theologian, writer, natural philosopher":1,"FRS, cleric, scholar":1,"FRS FRGS FLS FZS, naturalist, geologist, biologist":1,"Dr.":1,"neurologist, psychopathologist":1,painter:1},place_counts_dict:{},people_dates_lived:{}},foldout:"N",id:"131",desc:'This page features a large clipping of a 1948 article by Cooke from the Glasgow Herald reporting on "The hundredth anniversary meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which had just ended in Washington" and which reportedly "found itself dogged and finally cornered by an old cliché that subtle men have spurned ever since Samuel Butler gave it popular expression", namely, the warning that "man is too clever for his own good, that he suffers from the moral indigestion of his own discoveries". The article continues, stating that man is a "paranoid Prometheus whose cunning and strength have been exclusively devoted to releasing the forces of his own damnation". The article considers presentations across a range of subjects taken up at the meeting. The article\'s first heading is "Mastery of Nature", which discusses a trend away from "enchantment with the mechanical world" into "skepticism about the world of super-explosive energy" through a consideration of issues such as "Mesons, alpha particles, heavy water, isotopes, genes and hormones, [and] the control of communicable diseases". Other headings include "Without Boundaries", which discusses both the unifying force of science, and the fact that humans are surpassing their resources for the fulfillment of basic needs, "\'Menaces\' to Survival", which discusses "two \'menaces\' to mankind\'s survival" as being "the modern conquest of disease and the plans to redistribute industrial populations without regard to their population potential". Also critiqued here is home industry and the gap between "useful findings and their general application" in the building of homes. Another heading, "Atomic Space Ships", discusses "space ships propelled outside the pull of gravity by atomic energy", although the problem of waste heat currently impedes that plan, and warnings from the United States Atomic Energy Commission that "if atomic scientists continue to be made the butts of \'un-American smears\' the United States might find itself without enough of them to keep its lead in essential atomic research and in the further refinement and stockpiling of the atom bomb". Finally, under the heading "Politicians\' Maturity", Dr. Carl Sulzberger\'s critique of diplomats in his address to the UN is reported, which took place on the same day as the Association\'s meeting. He is quoted as describing the diplomats as "a group of children, aged about three and four, trying to break one another\'s toys or squabbling to get closer to the ice-cream dish without a thought of one another". This section concludes with a quotation from Freud, which reads "The internal-combustion engine utilises, I believe, about 19 per cent of its available energy. The human being utilises rather less, if by energy is understood the ability to do all the work he is healthily able, to love and be loved effectively, and to work amiably and creatively with his fellow-men".

The write-up reads "In previous issues (November 2 and 30, 1946, and March 29, 1947) we have published several photographs of the earth taken at great altitudes by cameras mounted in the heads of rockets of the V 2 type. Here we show remarkable examples recently secured at the White Sands rocket base headquarters in New Mexico. At the top and bottom of the page we show two mosaics - panoramas made by joining a series of exposures - the upper taken from a German V 2 rocket at a height of approximately 60 miles; and the lower from a U.S. Aerobee rocket at 57 miles. The large picture in the center is an enlarged section from the upper mosaic and gives some idea of the detail which can be secured. On comparison with the atlas, the upper mosaic is found to reveal the panorama (looking westward) of an arc which starts in Mexico, passes through Lordsburg and Albuquerque, and ends in the Sangre de Cristo Mts. The lower, a more vertical view, lies a little to the east and interestingly shows the launching site of the rocket and also that of the first atomic tests". The photographs\' captions read: "The curve of the earth revealed in a mosaic of photographs taken from a V 2 rocket 60 miles up", "A detail from the Global Air Survey photograph above. This enlarged section is taken from round about the Figure (1), showing the Northern parts of Mexico and looking westward towards the Gulf of California", and "From Mexico to Wyoming in a single view: An aerial mosaic from an Aerobee rocket 57 miles up". Onto the second image, which is the enlarged photograph from the first mosaic, Morgan has pasted in two text-based clippings. The first reads "\'These religionists who believe in the second coming of the Lord - which direction is the Lord coming from? If the earth is a ball the heavens would be wrapped around the ball, and every direction would be up. And again, how could the Lord and his crowd hop on with the earth going hell west and crooked through space?\'" The second clipping reads "Although they have seen rocket photographs showing the curve in the earth\'s surface, members of the \'Christian Catholic Church\' sect at Zion, Illinois, are still convinced that the earth is flat. The photographs taken from an altitude of 57 miles over the White Sands proving grounds in New Mexico this week, were waved aside by the overseer of the sect, Mr. M. J. Mintern, when a reporter produced them. \'When you have something really worth while in the way of proof that the earth is spherical let me know,\' he said." Along the top of the page, Morgan has included a few small clippings, including a black and white photograph of a male dancer taken from above, a black and white photograph of a lemur, a colour reproduction of Loraine Smith\'s engraving "Loss of the Chaplain", and a separate clipping explaining the context of "Loss of the Chaplain". The explanatory clipping reads "Loss of the Chaplain. The greatest misfortune that can happen to a Club of Fox-hunters, respectfully dedicated to the Humane Society. Painted by C. Loraine Smith. Published 1826. In \'Scenes with the Smoking Hunt\' the artist caricatured the habit of smoking while hunting. The scene is in the Quorn country, and Parson Bennett is being dragged out of a brook.

The caption for the images reads "Recently cleaned and repaired: the Mappa Mundi, or World Map, dating from circa 1290. (Bottom left) Detail of the British Isles, which appear on the circumference in the lower left corner. (Bottom, right) Detail of the Island of Paradise, which appear on the circumference in the top centre. (Dimensions approx. 64 in. high by 56 in. wide.). The write-up states that map was "drawn by, or for, Richard of Haldingham...probably about the year 1290" and was preserved in Hereford Cathedral. The article also states that the map was "cleaned and repaired . . . under the supervision of the Map Room of the British Museum". The map is described as being "centered on Jerusalem, with the east at the head, where Paradise is shown as an island. The centre of the lower half is occupied by the Mediterranean, which runs to the left of the Black Sea. The British Isles, on the circumference in the lower left corner, in part embody twelfth-century names. The map contains numerous drawings of men and creatures, often mythical, which figure in the works of the Latin cosmographers, and details have been added from Biblical history. The basis is probably a Roman map of the fourth, or perhaps the first, century." The map is also compared in the article to the "Ebstorf map of c. 1235, which was preserved at Hanover before the war. Portions of this map had been lost, and its present location is not known". Other clippings on this page include a sepia-toned photograph of a group of people sitting outside in a mountainous landscape, a cropped colour photograph of an American football player, and a black and white headshot photograph of Marlene Dietrich, which Morgan has annotated with the initials "M.D.". This page also includes a short clipping titled "Hush!!! Hush!!!", which reads "Afternoon of May 15, two Chatsworth, Calif., school boys were walking home when a \'burst of machine gun slugs\' began pelting the road and fields all around them. They heard no explosion and saw no plane, but they picked up some of the slugs - such as are used in nose-guns of jet fighters. \'A joint investigation by the police, Air Force and Navy failed today to find the source - etc.\' O-oh, say, can you see? By the dawn\'s early light!". Morgan has annotated this clipping with "FSM 34" in the upper left corner and "1951" in the lower right corner. A second text-based clipping reads "But still the most sought-after advertisement by connoisseurs remains the one, elegantly and quietly printed, which the manager of the famous hotel in Colombo slipped under the glass-topped tables in the dining-room after a typhoid scare - \'All Vegetables in this establishment have been washed in water specially passed by the Manager.\'" Morgan has also included a colour reproduction of the lithograph "The Battle Between Cribb and Molineaux". Next to this clipping, Morgan has included a brief write-up contextualizing the print, which reads "The Battle between Cribb and Molineaux. After Rowlandson. Published 1811. In this famous fight at Thistleton Gap, Tom Cribb (an early champion) vanquished the negro Molineaux for the second time. Prize-fighting was at this time at the height of its popularity, and although boxing-gloves were used for sparring practice and for teaching purposes, all important contests were decided with the bare fists. Tom Cribb was the first pugilist to undergo the rigorous training which is considered so important a preliminary of the boxing contests of to-day".'},{people_ids:["414","678","676","677","1"],sources_ids:["447","448","727","728","729"],people_roles:{1:["Illustrator/Artist"],414:["Depicted in clipping"],676:["Depicted in clipping"],677:["Illustrator/Artist"],678:["Illustrator/Artist"]},clippings:11,suffix:"",places_ids:["80","586","198","587","588"],notes:"pink ink doodle",number:"1520",orig_material:"Y",orientations:["mixed"],book_id:"3",keywords:["Celebrity","Men","Women","Nude","Collage","Statue","Glowworms","Cave","Moths","Midges","Fly","Chrysalis","Limestone","Boy"],stats:{people_nationalities:{American:1,English:2,Italian:1,Scottish:1},people_genders:{Male:5},source_dates:{},sources_rights_holders:{},sources_places:{},people_titles:{artist:1,writer:1,painter:1,"actor, film director, activist":1,"Dr., Poet Makar":1},place_counts_dict:{},people_dates_lived:{}},foldout:"Y",id:"140",desc:'This page features a large black and white clipping, which discusses a glowworm cave in New Zealand and includes four black and white photographs, three of which have captions. The image captions are "Limestone shaft leads down to glowworm cave", "Glowworm threads (above), each 6 inches to 2 feet long, hang like stalactites from cave ceiling. Not luminous themselves, they shine in photographer\'s light. Sudden light or sound makes glowworms turn lights off", and "Globules of Mucous enlarge threads (below). Hanging in center is later stage of worm, the chrysalis. From it will emerge the adult glowworm, a fly twice size of mosquito, which lives only long enough to lay eggs". The uncaptioned photo shows two small worms on a rocky surface. Onto the large photograph of the glowworm threads, Morgan has pasted in two clippings: a black and white photograph of a carved head and a black and white photograph of a young man in a suit, positioned so that the man in the suit appears to be looking up at the carved head. The article, titled "Glowworms: Their bright taillights help snare insects in dark New Zealand cave", describes the Waitomo Cave as "strange and lovely". The write-up describes the ways in which the glow from the worms attracts moths and midges to them, which are then entangled in thread and swallowed by the glowworms. The write-up continues, stating that "After several months of glowing and eating, the worm becomes a chrysalis and later turns into a fly". The large clipping has been folded over along its right-hand edge so that it will fit into the scrapbook. On the backside of the fold, Morgan has pasted three images: a cropped black and white reproduction of the Madonna\'s face from Botticelli\'s "Madonna of the Pomegranate" painting, a captioned black and white photograph of Richard Aldington, and a black and white photograph captioned as "The Temple of Neptune at Paestum, southern Italy". Also included on this page is a black and white newspaper photograph of Marlon Brando, for which Morgan has included a partial caption that reads "Brando", a line of text beneath the Brando clipping that reads "Brandy Marlo", a colour reproduction of Ayrton\'s painting "The Grandsons", a small black and white photograph that is difficult to make out, and a black and white photograph of a boy in a suit sitting in an ornate chair with his back to the camera.'},{people_ids:["679","680","681","682","683","684","685","686","687","688","827"],sources_ids:["453","449","450","451","452","730"],people_roles:{679:["Depicted in clipping"],680:["Illustrator/Artist"],681:["Illustrator/Artist"],682:["Illustrator/Artist"],683:["Depicted in clipping"],684:["Named in clipping"],685:["Named in clipping"],686:["Named in clipping"],687:["Illustrator/Artist"],688:["Named in clipping"],827:["Author/Writer"]},clippings:8,suffix:"",places_ids:["589","93","3","590","591","121","134","593","594","595","596","597","598"],notes:"",number:"1521",orig_material:"N",orientations:["portrait"],book_id:"3",keywords:["Archaeology","History","Culture","Pottery","Wares","Animals","Art","Women","Men","Skeleton","Death","Cemetery","Tomb","Iron","Lead","Jewelry","Arrow Heads","Music","Singer","Cat","Dog","Unexplained","Airplane","Helicopter","Military","Speed of Sound","Handwritten Clipping","Janitorial Services","Humour","Politics","Sculpture","Painting","Drawing"],stats:{people_nationalities:{Scottish:2,Dutch:1,Florentine:1,English:2,"Hungarian-British":1,Italian:3},people_genders:{Male:10},source_dates:{},sources_rights_holders:{},sources_places:{},people_titles:{"draughtsman, painter, printmaker":1,"statesman, de facto ruler of the Florentine Republic":1,"Captain, 1st Viscount Stuart of Findhorn, CH, MVO, MC, PC":1,"co-ruler of Florence":1,"Squadron Leader, DSO, OBE, DFC & Two Bars, AFC, FRASeS, test pilot, fighter ace":1,"sculptor, painter, goldsmith":1,"Baron, PC, Labour politician":1,"Sir, KCIE, FRAS, FBA, archaeologist":1,painter:2},place_counts_dict:{},people_dates_lived:{}},foldout:"N",id:"141",desc:'This page includes a clipping with two black and white photographs of busts, one captioned as "Giuliano Dei Medici: By Verrachio: Terra Cotta: Mellon Collection" and the other captioned as "Lorenzo dei Medici: By Verrochio: Mellon Collection". Morgan has annotated the clipping with a reference to other scrapbook pages, stating "cf 716, 1391". Also included on this page is a clipping containing two black and white reproductions of paintings. The first is captioned as "Above, \'The Singer\', by Keith Vaughan, from the exhibition at the Redfern Gallery", and the second captioned as "Below, \'Seated Woman\', a hitherto unknown drawing by Rembrandt recently acquired by and on exhibition in the British Museum". In between these two reproductions and below the captions, Morgan has pasted a black and white photograph of a skeleton in a grave. Other clippings on this page include a black and white reproduction of Bronzino\'s "Portrait of a Young Man", which Morgan has annotated with the artist\'s name and which overlaps on top of the reproduction of \'The Singer\', a short text-based clipping that reads "What was the meaning of the expression \'janitorial services\' in a Scottish Education Department circular? asks Mr J. Hoy (Leith-Lab.) in the Commons last night. Secretary of State James Stuart, replying, said they were \'services undertaken by those appointed to carry out functions or duties for which school janitors are responsible\'", a handwritten clipping quoted F. W. Lane, which reads "After one hurricane fruit trees flowered + bore fruit a second time. After another storm mulberry trees blossomed + bore a second crop of fruit. Similarly, after the Charleston hurricane in September 1752 trees which were stripped of their leaves blossomed again + bore fruit in the late autumn", which also overlaps on the Vaughan reproduction, and  a text-based clipping that references the writer\'s dog and its observed ability to distinguish between aeroplanes and helicopters, the latter of which it "violently protests against". The clipping then discusses the cat of Neville Duke, test pilot, who shows "the ability to detect the approach of those bangs which occur when aircraft exceed the speed of sound" well before the sound is audible to humans. The clipping concludes by stating that "The phenomenon is well known, I gather, to those who live near the testing areas of supersonic aircraft, and there have been many stories, hotly debated, of broken windows and displaced roof-tiles, but no humans have claimed to be able to sense the approach of what has been called this \'accumulated bubble of sound\' or of the slight shock-wave which accompanies it. Duke has no theory to explain the cat\'s prescience". The page also includes a large clipping that features a black and white photograph of a stone carving, captioned as "An animal in grey stone, about 4 feet high, used now as a Christian tombstone on the site excavated, but dating back to between 1500 and 1000 B.C." Below the photograph is an article, which Morgan has annotated as being from 29 December 1948, which discusses a recent English excavation expedition "at a prehistoric site near Rezaiyyeh, in Azerbaijan". The article reports that "Thanks to kindly assistance and co-operation on the part of the Iranian authorities, it was possible to obtain an excellently stratified sequence of material, mainly pottery, dating from the beginning of the third millennium until about 1,000 B.C". The dig extended to 44 feet down, and still did not "reach the original surface of the plain on which the site stood". The article then describes the various strata that were uncovered: a first stratum of "red polished ware" dating from 3,000 BC; a second stratum of grey polished ware, "some of it being ornamented with elaborate motifs, include the spiral, modelled in relief", as well as "Models of long-horned cattle and gaming pieces"; a third stratum of "elaborate black polished pots with grey rims and decoration of a previously unknown variety, consisting of a horizontal zone of shallow depressions, circular in shape and alternating with diagonal incisions", as well as "pottery of the Susa II type (about 2000 B.C in Southern Iran)", some tombs "equipped with pottery, bronzes, necklaces, and beautiful obsidian arrow-heads", and a "smithy with iron and lead ores"; a fourth stratum of "undecorated but polished red or black ware, with \'beak-spouted\' jars of a kind of tea-pot shape" and a cemetery; and a fifth stratum from "the close of the second millennium" with material "already well known to archaeologists from the explorations of Sir Aurel Stein 14 years ago in the same general area". The article concludes by stating that "The finds, which the Iranian Government most kindly allowed to be kept together (an act facilitating to the highest degree the study of ancient Azerbaijan), will, it is hoped, be on exhibition at Oxford early next year".'},{people_ids:["689","690","691","41","28"],sources_ids:["140","454","455","456"],people_roles:{28:["Depicted in clipping"],41:["Depicted in clipping"],689:["Illustrator/Artist"],690:["Photographer"],691:["Photographer"]},clippings:14,suffix:"",places_ids:["599","600","113"],notes:"",number:"1522",orig_material:"N",orientations:["portrait"],book_id:"3",keywords:["Collage","Rafflesia Arnoldi","Flowers","Jungle","Men","Earthworm","Wrestling","Sports","Art","Carving","Handstand","Christmas","Nativity","Cherubs","Religion","Advertisement","Socks","Clothing","Door"],stats:{people_nationalities:{"Galilean Jewish":2,English:1,Italian:1},people_genders:{Male:4,Female:1},source_dates:{},sources_rights_holders:{},sources_places:{US:1},people_titles:{"National Geographic correspondent, photographer":1,"Catholic saint":1,painter:1,"entomologist, photographer":1},place_counts_dict:{},people_dates_lived:{}},foldout:"N",id:"142",desc:"This page features a colour reproduction of Mantegna's The Adoration of the Shepherds, captioned as \"Christmas in a Fifteenth-Century Masterpiece.

They sail in the former British frigate Leith, which has been converted for their purpose. For two years they will cover the world\'s seas, dredging great depths and studying variations in the earth\'s magnetism. The sea serpent they are hunting is a grown-up specimen of the giant eel larva, about 6 ft. long, found off Cape Town several years ago. The adult eel is expected to be about 27 yards long". The second clipping is from the Evening News and reports that "Weather observers at Rockhampton Airport about 400 miles north of Brisbane, are keeping watch on a mysterious crescent-shaped silver object seen in the sky today. First spotted with a theodolite, a surveying instrument, when a weather balloon was being tracked, it appears the size of a pinhead to the naked eye. Captain B. L. Jones, a civil airline pilot, reported that he and his co-pilot last week watched an unidentified glowing object for about five minutes, 175 miles north of Rockhampton. Captain Jones said the object dived and climbed \'and there weren\'t any pink men waving at me either\'". The third clipping is from Samuel Butler author of Erewhon, (1835-1902): A memoir, and quotes Butler as saying "\'. . . as for the Trinity I cannot make head or tail of it, and feel inclined to agree with a Negro who was heard in church here the other day repeating the Athanasian creed: \'The Father impossible, the Son impossible, and the Holy Ghost impossible.

Below the image is a write-up, which states that the caterpillar will become "the beautiful Tiger Swallowtail butterfly, one of the commonest species of North America". The caterpillar is described as being "2 ins. long when fully grown, and greenish-yellow in colour. The \'eye\' spots are yellow, edged with black, and the \'pupil\' is blue with a black border. The true eyes are much lower down on the head, near the mouth-parts". The caterpillar also has "a pair of bright-coloured fleshy \'horns\' which can be projected from a slit in the dorsal wall of the prothorax. This slit can be seen in our photograph running across the base of the large upper \'lip\'. The \'horns\' are like the fingers of a glove, and are turned inside-out when in the body - the inner surface becoming the outer when the horns are projected. This outer surface gives off a highly disagreeable odour which has led to these caterpillars being called \'the polecats of the Insect World.\'" The caterpillar is said to eat "birch, poplar, wild-cherry, fruit trees and many other trees and shrubs." Pasted onto the bottom of the photograph, but above the caption, Morgan has included a smaller photograph of the same caterpillar, taken from the side, and beside this, in the lower right corner of the larger caterpillar clipping, he has pasted a colour photograph of a fish\'s head with an open mouth, seemingly chasing the smaller side-view photograph of the caterpillar. Pasted above the smaller caterpillar image, Morgan has also included an article from 1952 discussing the use of supersonic sound in "a variety of creatures, from shrimps to whales". The article cites the research of Mr. W. N. Kellogg and Mr. Robert Kohler who "conducted a series of experiments on this subject in a large tank at the Oceanographic Department of the University of Florida at Tallahassee. The tests were on bottle-nosed dolphins whose sound range rises from a low growl and groan-like sound to a shrill whistle which may rise to a frequency of several thousand cycles per second. These dolphins have highly developed acoustic receptor organs although they seem to be deficient in smell sense, which is surprising in creatures which obtain all their food under water." The experiments "produced underwater sounds from an oscillator with a range of 20 to 200,000 cycles per second. The stimuli were in short bursts of about two or three seconds. High tones had the immediate effect of increasing the swimming speed of the creatures. Low tones disturbed them even more; they broke up their swimming formations, leapt out of the water, and at times seemed to charge the sound machine. From these experiments it is inferred that dolphins possess an upper limit of hearing much higher than that of man, perhaps reaching an upper threshold of 80,000 cycles per second". The research also speculates that "The low frequencies may represent dangerous sounds such as ships\' propellers or the noise of surf beating on the shore". Other clippings on this page include a black and white photograph of a man kneeling down and playing a stringed instrument, a black and white photograph that looks like it might be a window shutter, a black and white photograph of a man in dark underwear posing in a seated position with what looks like a fishing net behind him, a black and white reproduction of drawing captioned as "No.42 - Tengus troubling the Sleep of Sagami (or Takatoki?).

Early 15th century", and "Two Fools in a Farce, from the Psalter of Bonne of Luxemburg. Circa 1340". Pasted in between the first two images, Morgan has placed three additional clippings on the page: a black and white photograph of a cherub statue, a black and white photograph of a young man in a suit, and a black and white photograph of a drawing (or carving?) of an old man in elaborate dress. Also included on this page are a colour reproduction of Turner\'s "Chichester Canal", which Morgan has annotated as "Turner: Chichester Channel", a colour photograph of a crystal sphere, a text-based clipping that provides context for the sphere, reading "From a half-ton piece of Burmese quartz came this flawless 106-pound crystal sphere, presented to the U.S. National Museum in Washington, D.C., in memory of Worcester Reed Warner, by his widow. It was carved in China and polished in Japan", a black and white photograph of a man in a cowboy hat and leather jacket sitting indoors with a cigarette between two fingers, a black and white photograph of a carved head with a dark substance around the mouth that resembles blood, a black and white photograph of a sculpture of two men, one of whom is sitting while the other leans over the first, and a black and white Thurber cartoon, which shows two women looking at a bird that resembles a penguin, standing with its back to them, captioned as "\'I Don\'t Know. George Got It Somewhere.\'" Also included is a black and white photograph of four planes flying over water, which is captioned as "Fastest fighter in operation is F-86, which holds official world\'s record of 670.9 mph. Able to reach 40,000 feet within five minutes, it will soon be our chief weapon for stopping enemy bombs. These are from 4th Fighter Group, Langley Air Force Base, Va.".

The page also features a colour reproduction of van der Weyden's \"Portrait of a Young Woman\". Other clippings include an original black and white photograph of a man wearing white underwear posing in a seated position, a black and white photograph of a furred shoe with claws, captioned as \"Nothing like a carnivorous shoe to emphasize feline femininity. The fur is attached to a wooden base and has a set of lion's claws\", a black and white clipping showing photographs of two stone carvings, one a relief sculpture and one a sculpture, collectively captioned as \"Left, 'The Booted Warrior': red sandstone pillar, from Bharhut Stupa Central India (second century B.C.); right, 'Woman Writing': sandstone attributed to Bhuvaneswar, Orissa (c.

The eagle clipping states that \"Not many golden eagles die a natural death, but I believe that, under favourable circumstances, their life exceeds that of a human being. We, or our successors, may in time learn more of this if the young golden eagles which are now being ringed in the eyrie are recovered in later years. When I was looking through an old newspaper-cutting book belonging to a friend, I came across a contemporary account of the shooting of a golden eagle. This bird was shot in France in the year 1845. It had a collar of gold round its neck, and on the collar the inscription was engraved: 'Caucasus patria, Fulgor nomen, Badinski dominus mihi est 1750. (Caucasus my country, Lighting my name, Badinski my master, 1750.)' The inference is that the eagle was used in falconry (as I believe it still is in the Caucasus) and may have been taken from the eyrie and trained for this purpose. But even if the collar had been placed round the bird's neck in the first year of its life, it will would have been ninety-five years old when shot in 1845. It had travelled far from its native land, but there was nothing in the newspaper report to show that it was old or failing in health\"."}]}},function(e,a){e.exports={book:{end_date:1960,number:"12",height:38.5,stats:{people_ids:["452","498","136","494","495","496","41","490","491","492","493","1","268","471","407","344","288","346","347","340","341","342","343","281","280","283","282","285","284","287","286","453","454","455","421","122","267","456","420","442","457","423","422","425","424","379","378","416","417","410","411","298","299","296","297","294","295","292","293","377","291","319","443","313","312","311","310","316","315","314","393","392","391","390","397","396","276","277","278","279","399","398","414","497","415","429","428","447","368","369","366","367","364","365","362","363","360","361","308","309","406","440","412","300","301","302","303","304","305","306","307","380","371","382","383","384","385","386","370","388","389","444","373","418","372","381","375","374","445","438","439","436","437","434","435","432","433","430","431","458","459","339","338","335","334","337","336","331","330","333","332","240","175","413","289","345","405","404","6","403","502","500","402","469","401","465","464","467","400","461","460","463","462","99","168","387","19","348","349","446","501","409","408","427","395","449","394","82","499","426","468","472","448","473","470","441","322","323","320","321","326","327","324","325","476","328","329","477","466","474","475","450","419","75","489","488","487","486","485","484","483","482","480","479","262","451","357","356","355","354","353","352","351","350","478","376","359","358"],pages_by_date_ranges_dict:{},pages_foldouts:0,clippings:716,places_ids_dict:{3:3,5:10,7:1,9:3,12:2,13:1,35:3,37:4,38:2,39:2,40:1,42:3,43:3,47:1,49:1,65:1,74:1,75:1,80:2,98:2,100:1,108:3,113:8,118:1,120:1,122:9,135:1,137:5,152:2,153:1,155:3,172:2,196:4,197:1,198:3,199:1,200:7,201:4,202:1,203:3,204:1,205:1,206:1,207:2,208:1,209:2,210:2,211:1,212:1,213:1,214:2,215:1,216:1,217:1,218:1,219:3,220:3,221:4,222:1,223:2,224:1,225:1,226:1,227:3,228:1,229:2,230:1,231:2,232:1,233:1,234:1,235:1,236:1,237:1,238:1,239:1,240:1,241:2,242:1,243:1,244:1,245:1,246:5,247:1,248:2,249:1,250:1,251:1,252:1,253:1,254:3,255:1,256:3,257:1,258:1,259:1,260:1,261:2,262:1,263:1,264:1,265:1,266:1,267:2,268:1,269:1,270:1,271:1,272:1,273:1,274:1,275:1,276:1,278:3,279:1,280:1,281:1,282:1,283:1,284:1,285:1,286:1,288:1,289:2,290:1,291:1,292:1,293:1,294:1,295:2,296:1,297:1,298:1,299:1,300:1,301:1,302:1,303:1,304:1,305:1,306:1,307:1,308:1,309:1,310:1,311:1,312:1,313:1,314:1,315:1,316:1,317:1,318:1,319:1,320:1,321:2,322:1,323:1,324:2,325:1,326:1,327:1,328:1,329:1,330:1,331:2,332:1,333:2,334:1,335:1,336:1,337:1,338:1,339:1,340:1,341:1,342:1,343:1,344:1,345:1,346:1,347:1,348:1,349:1,350:1,351:1,352:1,353:1,354:1,355:1,356:1,357:1,358:1,360:1,361:1,362:1,363:1,364:1,365:1,366:1,367:1,368:1,369:1,370:1,371:1,372:1,373:1,374:1,375:1,376:1,377:1,378:1,379:1,380:1,381:1,382:1,383:2,384:2,385:1,386:1,387:1,388:1,389:1,391:1,392:1,393:1,394:1,395:1,396:1,397:3,398:1,399:1,400:1,402:1,403:1,404:1,405:1,406:1,407:1,408:1,410:1,411:1,412:1,414:1,415:1,416:1,417:1,418:1,419:1,420:1,421:1,422:1,423:1,424:1,425:1,426:1,427:1,428:1,429:1,430:1,431:1,432:1,433:1,434:1,435:1,690:1,691:1,692:1},keyword_count_dict:{Communism:3,Poetry:9,"Atomic

Next to this clipping, Morgan has included two letters from the Evening News\'s "You Write" section. The first is from Mr. Darby, and although Darby says he saw a vapour trail at a different time than Robertson, he confirms that he saw something too. The second letter is from an anonymous writer who signs off as "Navigator". This writer states that "In the relative quiet of the countryside to the east of Glasgow, I watched this object fly around for almost twenty minutes. Beyond any doubt it was a twin jet of the Meteor or Canberra type. It had a decided twin trail and the sound of the jets could be heard". Also included on this page is a black and white photograph of an ornate quiver, captioned as "A coating of a Scythian quiver" and dated by Morgan as being from 3 BC, a black and white photograph of an engraving showing three figures arranged vertically, an original black and white photograph of a woman on a bicycle, a black and white photograph of a dog balancing four teacups and a saucer on his nose, and a large colour photograph of the outside of a blast furnace. In the left hand corner of this colour clipping, Morgan has pasted a colour photograph of the torso and lower body of a man leaning back in a chair. In the bottom left corner of chair clipping, Morgan has pasted a third clipping that reads "1 Only - Rocking Chair £12" and then, in letters typed upside on the clipping, "Less than half price! Spindle back".'},{people_ids:["395","396","1"],sources_ids:["85","262","639"],people_roles:{1:["Illustrator/Artist"],395:["Named in clipping"],396:["Named in clipping"]},clippings:10,suffix:"",places_ids:["113","345","324","221","346","155","347","39"],notes:"pink and blue ink doodle",number:"2267",orig_material:"Y",orientations:["portrait"],book_id:"2",keywords:["Titanic","Ship","Iceberg","Ocean","Survivor","Ben Nevis","Scottish Highlands","Film","Guitar","Men","Male Body","Sailing","Sea","Nature","Soldier","Musical Instrument","Language","Typo","Humour"],stats:{people_nationalities:{American:1,English:1,Scottish:1},people_genders:{Male:3},source_dates:{},sources_rights_holders:{},sources_places:{London:1,UK:1},people_titles:{"teacher, journalist, passenger on the Titanic":1,"singer, actor":1,"Dr., Poet Makar":1},place_counts_dict:{},people_dates_lived:{}},foldout:"N",id:"81",desc:'This page focuses on a long article that recounts Mr. Beesley\'s experience of the sinking of the Titanic.

Morgan has also included a 1955 clipping that discusses Cooper\'s invention of the Arcaid, a "blind-deaf machine, something like a small portable typewriter". The clipping states that Cooper was inspired by an airman rendered deaf and blind, with whom Cooper shared a hospital room.

The article goes on to discuss Aebersold\'s methods using radioisotopes, and states that the human body "should not be considered permanent in any material sense," although in a larger sense, "the atoms that each human body is made of were once parts of other living things . . . The atoms that made up Plato and Henry VIII are still floating around as parts of people now living". A second article on this page discusses the Grauballe Man and his display in Denmark following the successful preservation of the body by Hr. Lange-Kornbak. The Grauballe Man is said to be so well preserved that "police were able to take fingerprints", while researchers have surmised that the man was likely a nobleman who submitted to being made a human sacrifice to "Nerthsu" (likely a misspelling for Nerthus), the goddess of fertility. The article also discusses the Tollund man, who was not preserved and so remains now only as a head. A final clipping advertises treatment of "Rheumatism and Circulation Diseases" by "A.

It had no wings and at first I thought it was a helicopter, but it couldn\'t have been, it was too big". A larger article on this page discusses new research being done on the disposal of "radio-active wastes". The article states that a "cheap clay, shredded and baked until it resembles Chinese noodles" might allow radio-active waste to be handled and disposed of easily, as well as potentially offering "a practical method of packaging radioactive materials as useful sources of energy". The article concludes on a cynical note, stating "Then, too, after fluoride has gone out of style, the dentists can discover that radioactive noodles are exactly what city water needs to make us all grow teeth again, in the gums where today\'s panacea has defanged us.

Mahler is said to have "remembered a hurdy-gurdy playing \'Ach, du lieber Augustin\' in the street during an emotional crisis of childhood, and realised that this bathos must always be echoed in his symphonies".'},{people_ids:["430","431","432","432","433","434","435","436","437","362","442","443"],sources_ids:["297","298","299","300","234","11"],people_roles:{362:["Illustrator/Artist"],430:["Named in clipping"],431:["Named in clipping"],432:["Named in clipping","Depicted in clipping"],433:["Named in clipping"],434:["Named in clipping"],435:["Named in clipping"],436:["Named in clipping"],437:["Named in clipping"],442:["Named in clipping"],443:["Named in clipping"]},clippings:13,suffix:"",places_ids:["172","5","200","196","203","122","246","391","392","393","43","214","394","153","49","256"],notes:"",number:"2277",orig_material:"N",orientations:["portrait"],book_id:"2",keywords:["Sexual Politics","Communism","Books","Review","Family Values","Communist Party","Sea","Scuba Diving","Eye","Men","Male Body","Atom Bomb","War","Bomb","Robot","Weapons","Axe","Knife","Chain","Court Case","Law","Cartoon","Cigarettes","Dating","Animal Cruelty","Animal Testing","Monkey","Electricity","Science Fiction","Film","Mind Control","Cowboy"],stats:{people_nationalities:{Mexican:1,English:2,Japanese:1,American:1,Spanish:1,Soviet:3},people_genders:{Male:10},source_dates:{},sources_rights_holders:{},sources_places:{Pittsburgh:1,US:1,UK:1,Chicago:1},people_titles:{"writer, illustrator":1,Sheriff:1,"professor, physiologist":1,"Depute Fiscal":1,writer:1,"revolutionary, theorist":1,"D., writer":1,"medical practitioner, writer":1,dictator:1,"biologist, professor, sexologist":1,painter:1},place_counts_dict:{},people_dates_lived:{}},foldout:"N",id:"91",desc:'This page contains a large article by Crankshaw, focusing on a report by Kinsey, titled "The Sexual Behaviour of the American Female", and the reception this work has received in the Soviet Union. The article focuses on an attack by Leonov on Kinsey\'s book and discusses the ways in which sexual politics and family life are being framed, politicized, and discussed in the Soviet Union. Overall, Leonov sees Kinsey as "an instrument in the campaign \'to make man into beast, to spread the law of the animal world over human society in order to pervert and falsify the laws of social development, to justify war, to justify the lack of rights and the poverty of the workers, to justify the law of \'might is right\'\'". Leonov concludes that the book is "the most cheap kind of pornographic hash, clumsily disguised as science".

A French judge eventually ruled that the "French courts had no jurisdiction over the Bolshevik revolution and its artistic policies".

The article also states that the clergyman only laughed three times in his life, one of those taking place when a pudding on the fire "happened to cheep from the expulsion of air" during grace, causing a small child present to say "Weesht, weesht, pudy, . . . naebody maun speak here, but the man \'at seeks the blessing".

Around him, are a square and an oval, and it appears that another figure is standing back to back with the man, as the backs of two legs are visible next to the man's legs, and the backs of two arms are visible extending above the man's head. There is also what looks to be a fifth leg extending from the man's hip, although this may perhaps be a suggestion of movement, similar to Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. The caption reads \"Ode.

Morgan has also included a clipping titled "Look at Your Hands", which recounts a scientific study that claims "people whose ancestors came from different parts of Europe have different distribution of hair on the middle joints of their fingers." Next to a paragraph reading, "If you have no hair at all growing on these joints, your ancestors came from Spain, Italy, or Ireland", Morgan has written "[EM]" with a checkmark. One of the largest clippings on the pages is a black and white photograph from Life magazine of two empty work gloves resting the handles of a drill that is planted in concrete. On the bottom of this clipping, Morgan has pasted a small colour photograph of a hand and a ruffled sleeve.

Stamp 4 has been clipped from a different envelope, along with two other stamps, one depicting Stalin and Mao in the Kremlin and the other a red stamp depicting the Forbidden City. All three stamps have been marked with a black Peking postage mark from 1955.

Morgan has annotated the clipping with Giacometti\'s name in the upper right corner. Much of the rest of this page is themed around baths and water, with a black and white photograph of two men in a canoe reaching down to a third man who is swimming in the water, a black and white photograph of a crowd of people walking underneath a sign that reads "Baths" taken from above, an original black and white photograph of a naked man with a tattoo on his arm posing in the shower, a colour photograph of a spiral seashell, and a black and white photograph of Charlie Chaplin lying in a full bathtub while fully clothed and reading a newspaper. Three text-based clippings carry on this theme. The first is a paragraph which reads "Much of the woodwork of Longwood House was destroyed by white ants years ago, but the building has been repaired, and as a museum it will contain many things Napoleon used. For example, there is his bath, an antique affair with wooden sides. They told me Napoleon spent hours in it - he used to dictate his memoirs from it." The second is a short clipping, which reads "Trautmann, relaxing in his bath later, said, \'The Queen said to me, \'Well done!\', and the Duke of Edinburgh asked me, \'What is the matter with you?\'\'". The third is three clipped sections from O\'Donnell\'s short story "\'--House,\' Near Blythswood Square, Glasgow. The Haunted Bath." The clippings recount the ghostly activity around the bath, including sloshing water and the sounds of someone bathing, despite no one being visible. The last of the three sections that Morgan has included from this story reads, "Then something, he would have given anything to tell what, came out and began to steal towards him". On the end of this sentence, Morgan has added a colon and then has pasted in two extra lines of text from different sources, the first reading "Bulorns, Kenacks ad Lizamoo" and the second reading "plumb bobs with sheathes, grains of paradise, gate frames for penstocks, oil foggers, or even dehydrated kibble."
